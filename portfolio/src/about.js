                <h5 style = {{fontSize:'1.3vw', fontWeight:300}}>Software Developer, Media Artist</h5>
                <p>I have a passion to create a new system and art piece.
                 I worked for more than 10 years for semiconductor & LCD industry as software developer.
                 One day, by chance I encountered with a new media art installation. I was shocked at
                 how the installation gives me an impression. Since that time, I studied new media art
                 and general design from Art school. My interesting area is interactive art, sound
                 visualization, and algorithmic drawing. I have a huge enthusiasm to design and implement
                 creative projects by using different tools such as processing, openFrameworks, and Unity3D.
                 In addition, I studied computer graphics such as computer graphics pipeline, OpenGL, Shader
                 coding in my previous master degree study. I think it is beneficial for a developer to have
                 a varied background including tech, design, and art. I like to work with people who have a
                 different background, experiences. Also I'd like to teach people who don't have a chance to
                 though. Iâ€™d love for an opportunity to meet and talk further about how we may work together.</p>
