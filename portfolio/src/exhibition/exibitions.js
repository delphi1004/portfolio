            description : "In this interactive installation, the viewer experiences the fascinating phenomenon of light echoes. By moving their hand slowly within the frame, they can observe how their hand movements are reflected back in an audiovisual form. The project combines the use of a Kinect sensor, Processing, and Pure Data software tools to detect and reflect the audience's hand motion. As a team leader, I was responsible for suggesting ideas, conceptualizing the design, implementing a prototype, and overseeing the development of the final system using Processing. The aim of the project is to provide a unique and immersive experience that showcases the beauty of light echoes.",

However, as our ears, not our eyes, are the sensory organ responsible for perceiving and understanding this auditory information. Through my exhibition, I focus on making this unseeable data more tangible, exploring how our brain could potentially interpret sound differently if it was transformed into another medium. If a sound could be converted into an image or physical object, could that amplify our cognitive understanding of the sounds we hear? Or does it instead alter or interrupt this process?",
