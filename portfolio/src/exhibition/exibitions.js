            description : "A light echo is a physical phenomenon caused by light reflected off surfaces and returning to the observer with a relative delay. In this installation the viewer observes the input of hand motion returned to them in an audiovisual form. Moving hand slowly inside the frame the user can examine how the visuals and sounds reflect her movement. The work is created with software tools Kinect, Processing and Pure Data. In this project, my role was to suggest the ideas, concept design, implement a prototype, final system and lead software team. The development tool is processing and I used Kinect sensor to detect audience hand.",

However, as our ears, not our eyes, are the sensory organ responsible for perceiving and understanding this auditory information. Through my exhibition, I focus on making this unseeable data more tangible, exploring how our brain could potentially interpret sound differently if it was transformed into another medium. If a sound could be converted into an image or physical object, could that amplify our cognitive understanding of the sounds we hear? Or does it instead alter or interrupt this process?",
